TensorFlow is an open source software library for machine learning across a range of tasks, and developed by Google to meet their needs for systems capable of building and training neural networks to detect and decipher patterns and correlations, analogous to the learning and reasoning which humans use. It is currently used for both research and production at Google products often replacing the role of its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief. TensorFlow was originally developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use before being released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015
