## Deep Learning (Subfields of Machine learning)
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learning tasks that contain more than one hidden layer. Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, partially supervised or unsupervised.

TensorFlow is an open source software library for machine learning across a range of tasks, and developed by Google to meet their needs for systems capable of building and training neural networks to detect and decipher patterns and correlations, analogous to the learning and reasoning which humans use. It is currently used for both research and production at Google products often replacing the role of its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief. TensorFlow was originally developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use before being released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015

ConvNetJS is a Javascript library for training Deep Learning models (Neural Networks) entirely in your browser. Open a tab and you're training. No software requirements, no compilers, no installations, no GPUs, no sweat.
